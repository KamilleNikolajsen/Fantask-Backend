# Fantask-Backend

In this project we worked with the customer **Fantask A/S** on redesigning their internal systems. 

In the process many new technologies and tools had to be incorporated in this 4 week project.  
Among these: Lucene, convertion of access database to MySql database, grid and pop-ups.

This repository contains the API, to see the frontend check it out [here!](https://github.com/KamilleNikolajsen/Fantask-Frontend)


As a team we worked with a combination of **scrum** and **XP**.
Because of this we were able to receive feedback and develop our project combining our knowledge of systems and the customers knowledge on their day to day work processes!
